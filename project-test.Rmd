## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Otro plot

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

df = cars

df %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point(col = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Distancia Velocidad en Vehiculos",
       x = "Velocidad",
       y = "Distancia") +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(size = .5), 
        plot.title = element_text(family = 'serif', size = 20, vjust = .5, hjust = .5),
        axis.text = element_text(family = 'serif'))
```
